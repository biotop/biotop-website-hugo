bio = "Niko holds a PhD in Computer Science and an MSc in Molecular Biology and currently work as a bioinformatician. Since 2011, he works with next-generation sequencing data, both working with researchers on challenging biological/medical projects as well as doing basic bioinformatics research and method development. During his time at the University of Oxford, he was involved in several large-scale, translational whole-genome sequencing projects. Working with huge datasets from cancer and rare diseases, made him appreciate the power of statistical and genomics approaches for addressing fundamental medical and biological questions. He has recently started to apply Deep Learning-based methods to such data in order to uncover hidden, complex patterns that might lead to biological insight."
