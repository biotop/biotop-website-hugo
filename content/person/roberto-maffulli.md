bio = "Roberto studied as a mechanical engineer in Florence where he fell in love with fluid dynamics. While there, he worked on vertical axis wind turbines and aeroacoustics of airplane engines. During his DPhil at Oxford University he studied the coupling between aerodynamics and heat transfer in the hottest components of gas turbines using numerical modelling. He has worked at von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics on machine learning tools for automated optimization systems and is now a post-doctoral researcher at Oxford University working on multi-scale modelling of unsteady conjugate heat transfer. His research interests include: optimization algorithms, machine learning, computational modeling of turbomachinery flows, conjugate heat transfer."
