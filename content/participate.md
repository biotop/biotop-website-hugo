## What use is biotop to me?
Science? - Not my cup of tea!

To many, science means that people with a liking of acronyms and white coats do things in sterile labs or with complex formulae; things with an air of importance; potentially groundbreaking things; things, which but a handful of people in the world understand. - And surly these people also share a love of clumsy acronyms, white labcoats and blackboards full of scribbles.

While most labcoats are indeed rather dirty, most of these cliches are somewhat grounded in truth. However, the picture they paint has a key ingredient missing: passion!
Whoever does science is haunted; addicted to those moments when they catch a glimpse of the beauty of that which is. - Be it the microscopic world of the cell, where bridges selfassemble and disassemble themselves, while knobbly proteins wobble across at phenomenal speeds; the mysterious quantum world, where thing generally run counter to our intuitions fostered by the "big world"; or cosmic ballets, where celestial bodies are formed from stardust, and bend space and time.
For these glimpes take it on with their own ignorance, and pay the price of hitting the proverbial wall over and over again, before they broaden their horizon (a little bit).

Yet, for us all to profit from these singular events of broadening of one's horizon, in order to better cope with the complex world that surrounds us, science needs to be communicated. Not as an end in itself, but in a manner that's integrated into the research process.
This is where we see our responsibility as scientists towards society, and our mission as science collective.
Follwoing this rounte promises to be fascinating, for the stories we know to tell are breathtaking, and with artists at our side, we're sure to tell them in exciting ways.
